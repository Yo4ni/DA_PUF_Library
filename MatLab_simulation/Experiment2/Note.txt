We report the result of XORPUF_analysis01 in folder fixedBit

We run the CMAES on 2-XOR PUF where A1 is RAPUF and A2 is a classic APUF

The noise rate is 0.01 or noise is 1% and the number of measurements for MV is 30 

The number of CRPs is 70.000, we have 100 runs of CMAES

We want to see that whether the A1 can be caught by CMAES in 100 runs or not?

The result is NEGATIVE (NO), only A2 can be caught. It means that A1 is hidden from CMAES.
