Those file generated by XORPUF_simultion01.m in folder Becker_Attack 

In this folder, we simulate the original Becker's attack 

CRPs 70.000 crp
noise 0.2
U = 100 
10-XOR PUF

CRPs are newly generated during all the runs 

Goal: Is it right only the APUFs which have big noise can be seen by CMA-ES. 

Conclusion: NO, any model can be seen. But, the bigger noise, the more change to be caught by CMA-ES
