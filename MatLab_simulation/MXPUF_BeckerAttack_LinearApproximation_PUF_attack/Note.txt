In this case, we demonstate Linear Approximation attack on MXPUF, approximate MXPUF by an APUF. We build the model of APUF by using Becker's attack.  

The master file is: MXPUF_analysis00

We runs the attack on noisy MXPUF $U$ times 

1. First, we need to build a MXPUF model 
In each attack (k=1:U), 
we generate a new set of Q (TrS) and compute the response of noisy MXPUF for this Q (ComputeNoisyResponseMXPUF.m).

We get the noise information by using ComputeTheNoiseInformation
After that, we call the CMAES algorithm. 

2. After that, we compare the accuracy of wModel of APUF with MXPUF. 

Conclusion: 

1. We do 10 attacks at each position 32 for 64-bit (1,1)-MXPUF, noise rate 20%, CRP 200.000, iteration 1.000
