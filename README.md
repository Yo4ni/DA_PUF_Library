# DA_PUF_Library
Defense/Attack PUF Library (DA PUF Library)

Authors: Durga Prasad Sahoo, Phuong Ha Nguyen, Chenglu Jin and Kaleel Mahmood

DA PUF Library contains the following source codes:

1. MATLAB codes for simulating and attacking Arbiter PUFs, XOR Arbiter PUFs and Interpose PUFs. The availabe attacking methods include Logistic Regression, reliability based CMA-ES attack and CMA-ES attack based on challenge response pairs.
2. C# codes for simulating and attacking Arbiter PUFs and XOR Arbiter PUFs. Notice that, this C# code supports parallel computing. 
3. FPGA implmenetation of Arbiter PUFs, XOR Arbiter PUFs and Interpose PUFs.

If you need to reference to this library, please cite paper "The Interpose PUF: Secure PUF Design against State-of-the-art Machine Learning Attacks", authored by Phuong Ha Nguyen, Durga Prasad Sahoo, Chenglu Jin, Kaleel Mahmood, Ulrich Ruhrmair, and Marten van Dijk.
